# Damaged_Cans
This is a binary image classification problem. The goal is to classify images of cans as "damaged" or "not damaged".
We use different classification techniques as well as dimentionality reduction manoeuvres to simplify the dataset.

This is by no means a final or optimal solution, but an exploratory approach to this particular problem.
